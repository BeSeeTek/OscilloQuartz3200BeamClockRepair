# Oscilloquartz 3200 Repair Overview

With in this reposity i want to document all efforts repairing this beautifull Cesium Beam Atomic-clock comments remarks or help are warmly welcomed pleas write isuess to communicate with me.
The Clock has a moved history beeing orginialy purcheds in 1975/76 By the [ASMW](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Amt_f%C3%BCr_Ma%C3%9F_und_Gewicht) the GDR's Natinonal Metrology Institute.
In mid 80ths the Clock got an actual clock display modification using an 1973 Ti chip and GDR/USSR Chips.
After the unification of germany the clock came to PTB in Brunswik and was mostlikely last opperational in 1997 at least there was a note in the clcoks manual operation section saying that the backup Battery is dead and external 24 V Battery is needed to get the clock running.
Many of my collegues hasitated to throw this device onto the junk yard and so it came to me, to get an new chanche to runn again.  

The Beamtube looks very similar to the one used in the [FTS-4040](http://www.leapsecond.com/museum/fts4040/).
